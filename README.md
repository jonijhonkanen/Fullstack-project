# Fullstack-project

Project work for the TAMK Course 4A00EZ62-3003

This application lets the user to test their language skills
with a simple word quiz format. The application includes an interface
for administration purposes (modifying the quiz content stored in the database)
and the 'student' interface for testing their skills with the quiz.

### Background

This project is part of the Backend Development Course
in the University of Applied Sciences of Tampere. The reasoning
behind the creation of this application is to make sure that the student
knows the basics of both frontend and backend development, including database
handling, requests with external modules to the database, possible error handling and
related messages and creation of reasonable user experience.

The current development plan is to develope and update this project
until 14 of January 2022. Any further development is unsure.
