behind the creation of this application is to make sure that the student
knows the basics of both frontend and backend development, including database
handling, requests with external modules to the database, possible error handling and
related messages and creation of reasonable user experience.

The current development plan is to develope and update this project
until 14 of January 2022. Any further development is unsure.
